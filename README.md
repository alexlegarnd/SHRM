# Simple HTTP Repository Manager
It's a repository with basic functionality.

## How it works
Create a channel (alpha, beta, stable...) and upload a file with a version number (ex: 1.0.0).
The server will create 2 hash files (md5 and sha1) for checking integrity later (while downloading for example)
